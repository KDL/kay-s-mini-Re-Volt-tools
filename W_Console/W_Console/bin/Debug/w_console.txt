get the full path to your track's .w file (for example C:\Games\pc\revolt\revolt\levels\radiosity2\[color=green]radiosity2.w[/color]
then go to console and write 
[CODE]load C:\Games\pc\revolt\revolt\levels\radiosity2\radiosity2.w[/CODE]
[SIZE=1]load = open[/SIZE]

now in your information bar you'll be able to see

[u]Note:[/u] To avoid loading and reloading and rereloading, you can load once and then use:
[CODE]load lastfile[/CODE] (lastfile or "last file", both syntaxes are right)

writing [CODE]load[/CODE] is equivalent to "load lastfile"

[b][u]Getting meshes by Texture[/u][/b]
Now, about getting meshes, it's (no fuss) very hard, because you'll have to guess and etc...
Of course I'm kidding but not really joking because you really have to guess

Now, let's say the mesh is a floor which uses bitmap: A


[CODE]getByTex A[/CODE]
is equivalent to
[CODE]getByTex 0[/CODE]

possible: -1->26 ; A -> Z (however, current exporters only supports A->J)

[color=green][b]With world file is loaded and mesh loaded, it's possible to modify now[/b][/color]

getByTex doesn't pick/select meshes!
[dohtml]<hr/>[/dohtml]
[b][u]Listall polies[/u][/b]
In case you want to list every poly, you'll have to write
[CODE]listall[/CODE] (it doesn't need mesh selection in order to work)
[dohtml]<hr/>[/dohtml]

[b][u]Select a mesh[/u][/b]
to select/pick a mesh, you'll have to write (later will explain batch select meshes)
[CODE]select <meshnumber>[/CODE]
where meshnumber is a number ranging from 0 to [mesh count - 1]

for example: [CODE]select 0[/CODE] to select the first mesh

[dohtml]<hr/>[/dohtml]
[b][u]list/getinfo[/u][/b]
getInfo will write some small infos about current mesh
[CODE]getInfo[/CODE]

as for list, it will list all your polies inside current mesh
[CODE]list[/CODE]

[b][u]Shading meshes[/u][/b]
after selecting a mesh, it's time to shade it
There are 2 ways of shading here: Shading with transparency; Normal shading

Transparency means to set an alpha value, if alpha = 0 then the mesh is transparent, if alpha=255 the mesh is opaque 

[CODE]shade A R G B ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?{shade with transparence, if A=0: transparent}
shade 0 0 0 0 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? {trick to get transparent mesh}
shade R G B ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?{shade to R G B}[/CODE]
About RGB value, you can get it from Paint (Tools -> Modify colors) or any other places

[b][u]convert triangular to quads[/u][/b]
so it'd be used in Texture animation
[CODE]convert quads[/CODE]

[dohtml]<hr/>[/dohtml]
[b][u]Export current mesh (to .prm file)[/u][/b] (experimental)
[CODE]export <prmfile> ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? {export prm file}[/CODE]
ex: [CODE]export[/CODE] (to auto-name file)
or [CODE]export lolprmfile.prm[/CODE]

[align=center][color=blue][SIZE=7]World file stuffs[/SIZE][/color][/align]
you can backup and restore your world file through:
[CODE]backup[/CODE]
while backing up you'll find the backup's code (for example saved to ..._0.w" => backup code =0)

to restore your track; you can write
[CODE]restore[/CODE] which is to restore the latest backup
to restore the other backup (0 for example) write
[CODE] restore 0[/CODE]

[b][u]Setting nVolt/FreeVolts[/u][/b]

to note: nVolt > FreeVolts (unlike it's planned)
thus, if you install nVolt, freevolts will be disabled

Once nVolt or freeVolts are installed properly, W_console will be able to detect them and use them


[u]setting nVolt[/u]
[URL=http://www.box.net/shared/cmhdrqvb2hui4tucfy87]Download nVolt[/URL] then extract it to "my documents" (your documents of course)
make sure that the path is: <mydocs>\nvolt\nvolt.exe

[u]Setting FreeVolts[/u]
[URL=http://www.box.net/shared/0tftdz7b3vc7cd73rdme]Download Freevolts[/URL] and put it in [color=red]one[/color] of those directions:
1. Windows Root
2. System32 Root
3. near of the application

[dohtml]<hr/>[/dohtml]
[b][u]Preview[/u][/b]
with FreeVolts or nVolt already installed, you can preview a world file or meshes (experimental)
[CODE]preview *[/CODE] is equivalent to [CODE]preview world[/CODE] (with it, you can preview the whole world)
If you want to force FreeVolts to preview your world file
[CODE]fvwpreview[/CODE]

For Previewing meshes, you'll have to pick a mesh before then preview it
[CODE]preview[/CODE] equivalent to [CODE]preview mesh[/CODE]
To force FreeVolts to load the file, you can write
[CODE]fvpreview[/CODE]

preview will use nVolt if it's present; will use FreeVolts in case it's present/nVolt is absent
