OK zipper , all is done. The permission was stopped to all to post there. To the admins too lol. Now you can post ;) 
<ZR> yeah that was weird. i am enabling the 'people reading topic' feature, kay's blog was hacked and believes it was by a bot.

<reppiz> yeah. i am reppiz (zipper spelled backwards). kay asked me to do this to help protect the forum, its being modified with a program. dont ask questions please.
<miromiro> i hate this and i do what i need to !!!! 
<ZR> are you not comprehending what i said above? reppiz is me, for use with a program incase we get hacked by rst. it is a security measurement.
wtf are you freaking about?
<miromiro> what ?!?!?! i dont understand lol 
<ZR> just ignore the account reppiz and leave it to me.
<miromiro> ok 
<ZR> what do you think about making tomo alien the moderator of tracks? i was thinking that but he has to post here at least once a month to keep the job.
sound good to you or not?
<miromiro> well let's remember that to be mod you need time and knowledge. Also you must control the power too. Also he isn't too active and post in the tracks sub forum too much but i'll talk with him. At least the idea sounds nice ... 
<ZR> yeah
<miromiro> so should we talk with him ?
<ZR> yeah but i want to speak with him personally. in rvhouse. sent an email to him
<miromiro> OK , let's talk about something else ;)

i wont fight with you because you are one of my best friends but better do what i say , will help ;) 
<ZR> look, i only took away his posting privileges for 3 days, cause he spammed some topics. there was no need to post 8 times in a row. then i cleaned up the spam. idk what your worked up over...
and i never said i wanted him out of the forum.
<miromiro> well ... i dunno but he says that he will leave also who we can make super mod ? Kay ?! 
<ZR> sure, kay is a nice guy, and has helped us in many ways. vic wont leave, he changed.

<miromiro> Bored...
<ZR> HOLY FUCKING SNOW! lmao. we have 3 feet of snow overnight. o.O
<miromiro> New updates!
<ZR> ok great
<miromiro> I can't believe. My grandmother is on a step to die :(. I feel very very sad & bad :(. 
<miromiro> She's dead. 
<ZR> thats sad
<miromiro> Very. 
<ZR> did you save the signature picture? imageshack deleted it.

<miromiro> Man, stop deleting so much! Please!!!! 
<ZR> dude its all spam, theres so much spam in the forum its sad.
<miromiro> ... Okay... :/
<ZR> 3 word story is starting to get out of control. they were talking about drinking cum, wtf.
<miromiro> Ah come on, don't be so!! Why you close all the active topics? There is the FUN House. Where they want to have FUN. Please, don't be so rude :(
<ZR> you dont even know what cum is...
<miromiro> Bleh, however. Can you take sometime a picture with you? I'm curios how you look :)) 
<ZR> mehhh. maybe. you misspelled 'curious'.
<miromiro> Great! RVL is on the links list of RVZT! :)
<ZR> awesome.
<ZR> http://z3.invisionfree.com/Revolt_Live/index.php?showtopic=818&st=0#entry4489104
edit a single word in this topic and i will kill you. just saying.
<miromiro> :P I won't. 
<ZR> added the Re-Volt Errors subforum.
<miromiro> Okay nice, but Zipp, let's try to think twice, I just want to be admin here with YOU. I'm not angry but sometimes I feel like everyone does what he wants with this forum. Let's keep it under control a little bit more... 
<ZR> mmhm.
<miromiro> I'm getting bored. I have exams here these days. So, how are you? 
<ZR> SSDD. same shit different day. nothing changing here at all, just the seasons...
<miromiro> Dude, I got sick! I want summer NOW! 
<ZR> i cant wait for school to be over... 17 days left, it ends on june 9th.
<miromiro> You're lucky. We have a week more, on 13.
<ZR>  For the love of god, don't edit my posts.
<miromiro> Sorry dude.
<ZR> you do realize AGT only joined to make that smart ass reply right? me and him are getting really mad with adam recently, adam's being such an asshole in #revolt-chat.
<miromiro> Fuck this shit, I get pissed off slowly. Seriously, didn't you notice that no one cares about the forum rules? Fuck!
<ZR> Uh didnt you JUST ADD a new rule with swearing and they you swear here? Ironic? i think so.
<miromiro> Don't be frustrated. The guys will vote for me! In fact, no one likes swearing. 
<ZR> uh huh. and you locked it.
<ZR> lol at the bottom it says 'The newest member is' and theres no name -.-
<miromiro> Hey man! Holidays are coming! Vacantion!!! :D
<miromiro> LeetCake came back. Now's the time me to tell you something like 'I told you'. So, we're not gonna deleted any other members, okay? If they want to become red, banned, that's alright. 
<ZR> where did rickyd's thread go?
<ZR> what the fuck just happened? fucking rrr again? come on!
<miromiro> It's damned conflict. RRR took the thread info from RVL and announced about it on RRR, placing RVL in a bad light showing that on RVL are allowed bad words. That's the only bad they for us, the rest is not our problem. Luckily, it wasn't announced on Wiki, yet. 
<ZR> R6TE showed it to other people. its his fault...
http://urnemanden.com/Scret3/pancake/RLive.htm
<ZR> i see nero is no longer in charge of st race because it doesnt exist anymore lol.
<miromiro> Exactly :(
<ZR> AI Tut, finish it. lol
<ZR> ...
<ZR> you going to finish it or what?
<ZR> come on...
<miromiro> Gee man. Stay calm. By the way, what happened with the Avatar Size option?
<ZR> don't know, must have been a bug or I changed it accidentally.
<ZR> stop setting nero in moderators please. he isnt moderating anything anyway...
<miromiro> Okay, then. Next time when you'll visit the Admin CP look at Board Logs -> View Admin Logs. That will show you the latest Admin action. I won't do any change. And you'll see that tomorrow, Nero will be grey again. And you'll think that I did something. Then go and check the Admin Logs and see if I did anything. Because it will say that you did the last Administration change.
<ZR> i see, thats gay. i think he doesnt log out and it resets.
also i approved vics request for a suspension on nero. maximum of 3 days.
http://z3.invisionfree.com/Revolt_Live/index.php?showtopic=1013
Do not touch that topic.
<miromiro> Whatever, come some time on RVHouse, we need to talk.
<ZR> http://if.invisionfree.com/topic/5093561/1/#new
<miromiro> D'oh! I asked that already. http://if.invisionfree.com/topic/5093530/1/#new
Anyway, I think I fixed it. I remember that I added an auto promotion. It promotes every member to Moderator if he/she gets 1000 posts.
<ZR> LOL fail.
<ZR> joined RVHouse today and you weren't there.
<ZR> damn zymic and their downtime....
<ZR> dude. notes. where? also where have you been?
<miromiro> Dude. Notes here. Been in Holiday! :P
<ZR> insane.
<ZR> school starting on monday.
<miromiro> Already? We just on 14 September.
<ZR> i have school today, i must wake up at 5:30 AM and currently it is 12:44 am. hmmmm.... i drank too many energy drinks. fuck my sleep schedule...
<miromiro> Great, so I guess you're going in 11th grade? Or 12th? 
<ZR> 11th, after this year 12th, then i am finished for good.
<ZR> adding music and movies, new subforum.
<miromiro> Hey man, sorry, but I couldn't help you the last week. My PC has some trouble. I think you're gonna administrate the forum alone for a while. Sorry. And just a suggestion, set your account as Anonymous, it's cooler. 
<ZR> it's cooler? i dont care if its cool or anything. alright thanks for letting me know, i promise the forum won't collapse into a fireball of eternal doom. :)
<miromiro> Yeah, probably. Anyway, I think I quit administrating the forum. 
The reason is that people don't give a fuck if I'm admin or not, if I'm in the community or not. Even Kay ignored me. I just felt upset when I seen that I'm not on Kay's thank list for his comic project, and I don't think he forgot me 'mistakely'. Think about...
<ZR> If you dont want to be an admin thats your choice.
<miromiro> I want to be Admin, but just wondering what people think...
<miromiro> So, how are you?
<ZR> a bit tired :) you?   17 today, hell yeah :)
<miromiro> I'm happy. I had some exams where I did good. :)
Gonna be a cool holiday. :D Happy birthday!!!
<ZR> thanks, blah exams. thats never fun.
<miromiro> Yeah, anyway, I escaped this time. :)
Good luck with your exams anyway!
<KDL>Great Job all, Just finished modifying the scripts, now will be uploaded in two cases
Medals GUI: http://www.box.net/shared/xqj7obbe5p (will generate the HTML code for you)
to validate the stuff, click Ctrl+Enter (Enter only = new line)
Medals GUI Tutorial (very important!) : http://www.megaupload.com/?d=QA2DL2VY
<ZR> Public topic. http://z3.invisionfree.com/Revolt_Live/index.php?showtopic=1257
<KDL> somebody attacked the whole server (not only rvl) and the backup replaced   with those weird chars. no worries all is fixed
<KDL> redoing the whole work...
<KDL> Done my part here :) . Going to send you the sources (pictures) and BotVolt!
<miromiro> Welcome in the administration Kay. :)
<KDL> thanks =), sorry for delay, too much homeworks indeed
<miromiro> Hmm, it's some kind of holiday here. There not?
<KDL> not at all, we're having a holiday of holidays (that means: all we do is study and have headache all day long...) :'(
<KDL> [subject: BOT, new one for pictures, words and reporting]
<miromiro> I quit from being an Admin for a week or maybe forever, who knows. To Kay and Mike, just replace me and do the things I usually do. Check the Validating members. ACP -> Users and Groups -> Manage Validating. Good luck in administrating without me!
<KDL> well, just picking the best of the best for moderating the forum. 
<ZR> invisionfree images are.... where? lol this page is very white without images.
<KDL> weird working here :o
<ZR> disregard, i am an idiot and had adblock blocking them.
<ZR> Suspended Candy.
<KDL> what has he done this time?
<ZR> he posted a picture of a dead girl after her head got run over by a car. It was up for 20 mins or so before I caught it, I don't think anyone saw it though.
<KDL> phew thanks, I would get a heartattack by viewing this :)
<ZR> lol, gore doesn't phase me much. i just see it and go 'heh'. I suppose that makes me weird.
<ZR> Perma IP banned Candy. You can see what I sent him when I suspended him in the quote.
http://imageshack.us/m/192/9048/permabanned.png
Oh and I changed banned's color back to red.
<ZR> I changed THE_HARVESTER's name color to dark orange, per request.
<KDL> wow, The harvester is spoiled lol
<ZR> LOL THE_HARVESTER-san nice one hah
<KDL> lol thanks.
<KDL> so, our first banned one is Candy... (took two years)
<ZR> yeah thats pretty good, one guy in two years.
<ZR> Moved a few things around... Also is it alright if i kill the weekly challenge, its been a year and it hasnt been touched.
<ZR> Changed Custom HUDs to Huds and minimods.
<KDL> Indexed staff room. going to implement some new CSS3 stuffs
<ZR> RVLCC 2 launched! http://z3.invisionfree.com/Revolt_Live/index.php?showtopic=1455
<KDL> gokuro sama deshita, the labs will be opened in few days
<ZR> Roger that.
<miromiro> You... banned Candy? :O
<KDL> and I banned another person
<miromiro> Yeah, let's ban them all fools. 
...WHO DELETED THE OTHER CONTENT?! I'LL BAN YOU!
<KDL> what other content...
<KDL> Speaking about content, I've just modified the RVL's 2nd birthday topic, which used to show how irresponsible was creating RVL and it's "not more than a joke". and also "advertising in this forum and this forum, look here it's done there?" which were totally pointless.
<ZR> Why is miro banned? He banned himself.
[DELETED]
<KDL> miromiro is unbanned now
<miromiro> Why you deleted the "Regarding miro" topic? I was curios! :P
<KDL> If you already know, why asking then? :)
<KDL> Style changer not working for FF 4.0, FF 5...

<KDL> Nero said that he'll be going to move Lego extremes (which are only legos) to Lego track section
<ZR> Alrighty... Added 'Remodel' section to repaint cars, since it is a branch of repaint cars and I didn't want to put YET ANOTHER SUBFORUM. We really need to work on making everything more compact.
<KDL> Google chrome only causes troubles, because of security "cloneNode()" is no longer available... trying to fix...
<miromiro> So Kay, what's the secret behind the big Competition text at the index?
<KDL> what secret?
<miromiro> Bye! (miro banned himself, and gone for good)
<KDL> everytime I see this I facepalm
<ZR> Actually i laughed. call it bitchy, but that was just one of the most stupid things I've ever seen in my life.
<KDL> Meitantei KDL is taking the case of "the Lurk = miromiro"! :P
<ZR> Instantly deleted Tua's account. I dont want him here too...
<KDL> Yep, me neither
<ZR> I have added the suggested locked forum for our creation group. Password is R3V0L7.
<KDL> Reload is now taking place each 5 mins instead of 10 mins
<ZR> This refreshing page thing again? Whats the point?
<KDL> it was always on, hmm but 10 mins instead of 5 mins.
<ZR> 5 minutes is just too short.
<KDL> it's now 10 mins and added "refresh if there is no video"
<ZR> What the flying fuck happened to the forum?
<ZR> Refer to image: http://img838.imageshack.us/img838/4495/wtfwr.png
Nothing is showing, I know its all still here from the category manager. I think it is your countdown script, took a look but I am unable to locate the correct script >_<
<KDL> very sorry, fixed now, but on the "bright side" a new record in "people online"
<ZR> lol, nice.
<KDL> sorry to be inactive lately but has to get used to be outside Re-Volt scene so it wouldn't be a shock for me :-/
<KDL> anyway, as UR told me a month ago that he quit Re-Volt scene for a while, then miro adds that he will no longer be here, I put him in the Staff Room, (sadly to hear that I have to do the same too for me later :( )

<KDL> @ZR: BotVolt is now closing the topics
<KDL> Dave has done a lot for us, he deserve to become a moderator (that's the least we could do)
As for Nero, I think supermoderator is more than enough
<ZR> Yeah that's fine
<KDL> added rv@facebook as official fb page for RVL
<KDL> luckily the internet wasn't cut, so, the only reason I can't be here is because of studies; see ya :)
<KDL> I may show up in 3 weeks for uploading Car::Load (3D editor), for now see you :)
<ZR> Alrighty.
<miromiro> Got bored?
<ZR> Miro you accidentally removed strix's account... >_<
<miromiro> Lmao. Sorry. :P
Why you never validated it anyways?
<ZR> Seemed good as it was, he was posting, I leave it to the members to auto approve their accounts, that way their email is legit.
<ZR> HOLY FUCKING GUEST COUNT. There's 46 people on the forum right now, and 42 are guests...
<miromiro> China likes Re-Volt, lmao.
<miromiro> Say something. October 5th.
<ZR> No. October 8th.
<miromiro> 3 days to answer. We're becoming inactive.
<ZR> Nah, I've got no reason to check the admin CP anymore. Really there's nothing happening that requires administration. You forgot to hide the tips and tricks from the members, they can see it inside staff room.
<miromiro> Yeah, I keep on forgetting. To be honest, I'm damn proud of what RVL became. :)
<ZR> Hell yeah, it's one of the main Re-Volt sites now. *pats on the back*
<miromiro> Actually, it's even better. Look at our most recent member! :O
<ZR> Dunno if you mean sobar with the ':O' in a bad way, or CADster with the ':O' in a good way. I'm going to assume you mean CADster, I was shocked by that too.
<miromiro> I actually meant it to CADster. I thought he left years ago. His Shelby AC Cobra makes him famous to me! :P
<ZR> Banned sobar. Again...
<miromiro> Did you read the Staff Room?
<ZR> Yeah but I don't want that car stealing idiotic spammer on the forum.
<miromiro> Lmao, did you see what lu9 did on RVZT? Insane.
<ZR> Thought he was done doing that too...
<miromiro> Alright, just banned some more useless accounts...
<ZR> Froa?
<ZR> VIP group added, this is so they can see the VIP (staff) room without needing to be moderators. This is because there are definitely some people who can help make decisions without needing to actually be a staff member.
<ZR> Opera mobile is broken for RVL.
<miromiro> I'm bored. I'm typing this on December 13th, 2011. It's 22:51 GMT+2 and I have tomorrow school. I might have tomorrow either a great day or a fuckin' one. I'm typing this now so I can see tomorrow how I did react now and how I'll react tomorrow. I'm also waiting for 1.2 like a fuck-ass bastard, all the time spent without motivation-races kill me. Sorry for writing such a stupid non-senseness but I'm fuckin' bored. Lmao. See you soon. Come to RVHouse from time to time. In week-ends especially, I miss chatting directly with you. =)
<miromiro> ...aand it's the other day. Happened just what I was expecting. Well, that's it. My only hope right now is just to get past nicely over the next days and to get that 1.2 update until the end of the week. Also, it's December 14th, 2011 here, 16:10 GMT+2.
<ZR> Sounds like you're having a great time! - Dec 18th. Slow response time ftw?
<miromiro> Nah, not really. Had some fucked up three months. Fast reply ftw! (December 19th, 2011)
<ZR> Yeah, one day reply, WHOO. -Dec 20th.
<miromiro> I'm bored. One day after. ^
