A portmanteau of recap and "PACKage" backwards is born the word "r e k c a p" 


REKCAP is a powerful wizard-based tool for Correct packing your track file as well as polishing the current files
Here is what it can do!



[*] Modify track folder name on the fly (as you press keys, the track folder should be correctly renamed)
[*] Modify track name on the fly (same, name in inf changes at the same time you press keys)
[*] Check for Junk files
[*] Add rain/lightning/skybox on the fly
[*] get a review about pickups 
[*] get a review about shading, polygons count and bitmaps
[*] generate mipmaps (bmq and bmr)
[*] generate  a super fancy readme file
[*] resizing a GFX file and applying it correctly
[*] compress into ZIP correctly (You may want to pick which are to pack!)
[*] get a score about how EFFICIENT is your track (it's not how good, it's how efficient in term of resources)
