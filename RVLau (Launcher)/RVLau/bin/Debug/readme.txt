Re-Volt Auto track launcher (abr. Re-Volt auto launcher, abr. RV Lau)
A small tool coded in VB.NET.
- It allows you to launch a track directly in single mode (you don't have to keep pressing OK or enter or joypad)
- If you're working on a track in 3ds max and have ase2w in your windows directory or folder directory:
It detects if a new .ase file is there, if so, it waits until fully exported from 3ds max then it launches ase2w (optional -morph or -ali) then automatically launches Re-Volt (and single race)
- If you edit directly the world file in Blender, W_Console or TexYUI, it will directly launch Re-Volt then goes to the latest reloaded track.
