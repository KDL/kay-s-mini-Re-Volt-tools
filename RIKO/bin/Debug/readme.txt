+-------------------------+


 (useless) Intro
+----------------+

RIKO is from 'Recolor' as spelt in French.
It also can be written as —œŽq "Pear Child", a japanese name.

In fact RIKO is a fork from CarLighting blended with Car Studio engine.



 (useful) Intro
+---------------+
 RIKO is an advanced version of 'Carlighter' 
 which was also codenamed Carlighting and finally called AutoShade

 Unlike Car Lighting, Riko has more reqs.
  1. An Installed and used Car::Load (version 1.4 and above)
  2. .NET framework 3.5


 What can Riko do:
   1. Set a Light Normal (direction of light)
   2. Set a Light Distance (Light position)
   3. Multiplier (Light Intensity)
   4. Base Color

   5. A stupid banner, which will be used (G.W) in Car Studio (C::L v2) for suggestions 
   6. Textured/Untextured mode (even yeah I saw that bug but I'm in rush....)



 How to use
+-----------+
First Pick Either "Color by Vertex" or "Color By Poly" 
After setting a proper Light Normal and Light distance (and probably main color) you can see the 
effect in Realtime.

Also to note, it doesn't work as 'rvshade' however you can use 
   LIGHT NORMAL: 0.0 0.0 0.0
Then modify the main color and tada!

Usually, the best settings is:
  LIGHT NORMAL: 0.0 -1.0 1.0
  LIGHT DIST. : 1.0  5.0 1.0

But it depends on cars which is the best
also it's possible to use default:
  LIGHT NORMAL: 0.0 -1.0 0.0
  LIGHT DIST. : 1.0  5.0 1.0

I also believe that some should have "Color by poly"!
