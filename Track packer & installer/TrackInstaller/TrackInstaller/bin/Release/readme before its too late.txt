Hello and thanks for trying the track installer

Getting started:
1- run Config.exe (you can run it anytime, once it's set you don't need to repeat it again...)
now using config.exe, set Re-Volt directory (AutoDetect is available as well)

2- Go to TrackInstaller\trackinstaller.exe, and press Install

3- Please feedback / comment / suggest anything releated to this application in the RVL forum

Thanks you :)
